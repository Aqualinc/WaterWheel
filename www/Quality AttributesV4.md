## Attribute and criteria descriptions ##
# Dissolved Oxygen (Ecosystem health)#
#### *Description* ####
Long term 7 day mean of the summer (1st November to 30th April) daily minimum amount of dissolved oxygen in the water at Motupipi River at Reilly's bridge (percentage of saturation).
#### *Scenario values* ####
"Status Quo" value taken from observed data 2006-2015 as 65 %. Young (2006) found that the ecosystem at Reillys Bridge is reliant on organic matter from upstream or the surrounding catchment and that the high plant production (which lowers the DO) is related to  the very clear, relatively calm and shallow water, and high nutrients. The groundwater source  is also low in DO. Members of the FLAG point out that the lack of flushing flows from the Takaka river in recent years has prevented periodic removal of plant growth. Of these factors, nutrient loading may be related to land use and stream depth may be related to the catchment water use. The scenario values increased or decreased the DO by an arbitrary 5 % depending on if the nutrient loading is likely to increase or decrease, or if the stream flow increases or decreases (according to Weir and Fenemor 2015). The exception was the "Natural State" scenario which was allocated a 10 % increase in DO. The "Irrig" scenarios were kept the same as the status-quo as they did not include a change of irrigation in the Motupipi catchment.
#### *Criteria settings* ####
The green lower limit was set to the 65 %, the lower yellow was set to 62.5 % and the upper red limit was set to 50 % (which matches the national policy statement (NZ Government, 2014) “B” standard of 5 mg/l (50 % at 16<sup>o</sup>C and 1016 hPa). These values were set following the "criteria setting meeting" of Takaka FLAG on 21st August 2015.

# Macro-invertebrates (Ecosystem health)#
#### *Description* ####
Macroinvertebrate Community Index (MCI) score at Kotinga. Values range from 0 to 200, where 0 indicates no macro-invertebrates.
#### *Scenario values* ####
Used a model derived from the work of Clapcott and others (2013). Changed the flow statistics input to the model based on the results of the stream flow modelling of Weir and Fenemor (2015). Bias adjusted model outputs by the difference between the observed and modelled MCI at Kotinga. Adjusted the model results across the uncertainty range based on the scenarios' landuse intensities.
#### *Criteria settings* ####
Low green set to 135, lower yellow set to 120, upper red set to 110. Minimum and maximum set to 100 and 150 by extension of the mid-range series.
These values were set following the "criteria setting meeting" of Takaka FLAG on 21st August 2015.

# Milk solids (Economic)#
#### *Description* ####
The change in milk solids produced within the Takaka catchment (%)
#### *Scenario values* ####
For the “Status Quo” scenario, the number of cows on irrigated and non-irrigated land is 6624 and 7831 respectively (pers. comms Mirka Langford). On average, in the Takaka valley, a non-irrigated cow produces 360 kg MS/year and an irrigated cow produces 424 kg MS/year (pers. comms Mirka Langford) leading to a total of 5.7 million kg MS / year.
For the “no consumptive use” scenario the currently irrigated land was assumed to change from the estimated irrigated land stocking rate of 3.3 cows/ha to the estimated dryland stocking rate of 2.8 cows/ha (pers. Comms. Mirka Langford) leading to a reduction of ~1000 cows all producing the non-irrigated 360 kg MS/year (totalling 4.8 million kg MS / year or a reduction of 16 %).
For the “double irrigation” scenario, it was assumed that an extra 2007 ha is converted from dryland to irrigated with an associated change in stocking rate (2.8 cows/ha to 3.3 cows/ha), i.e. an additional 6624 irrigated cows, and 5620 less non-irrigated cows (~1000 extra cows overall) leading to 6.4 million kg MS/year, an increase of 12 %. The "Irrig1:3" scenarios had extra irrigation areas of 494, 574 and 794 ha respectively, so the milk solids were changed accordingly following the method for the "double irrigation" scenario except for the use of the appropriate irrigation area changes. For the "Natural State" scenario cow numbers were set to 0. It was assumed that land use did NOT change from non-dairy to dairy. 
The remaining scenarios were assumed to keep the same number as the status quo.
#### *Criteria settings* ####
Minimum set to -100%. Maximum set to +50% which would be the case with 80 % of all available irrigable area (7740 ha) stocked at the irrigated stocking rate (3.3 cows/ha). 80 % is to account for land use efficiency (i.e. non-pasture land area). Yellow-orange is set to the status quo estimate. Red-orange set to -10 % below the status quo. Yellow-green set to +10 %.
These values were set following the "criteria setting meeting" of Takaka FLAG on 29th July 2015.
 
# River low flows (Ecosystem health)#
#### *Description* ####
Average number of dry days at Paynes Ford (above the Oxbow )per year (days)
#### *Scenario values* ####
Used groundwater model outputs (Weir and Fenemor 2015) offset by the difference between the modelled "Status Quo" values and the Tasman District Council synthesised estimates.
#### *Criteria settings* ####
yellow-green set to 41, which is the "status quo" scenario estimate. red-orange set to 44. Orange-yellow set to half way between.
These values were set following the "criteria setting meeting" of Takaka FLAG on 29th July 2015.
 
# Spring flow quantity (Cultural and spiritual)#
#### *Description* ####
Seven day mean annual low flow at Te Waikoropupu springs (litres per second).
#### *Scenario values* ####
Used groundwater model outputs (Weir and Fenemor 2015).
#### *Criteria settings* ####
Minimum set to 5830 l/s. This is the “natural” estimate. The maximum was set to 7500 l/s as this is the nearest 100 l/s above the highest estimate (from the “no consumptive use” scenario). Lower green set to 7290 l/s, lower yellow set to 6900 l/s, upper red set to 6500 l/s. These values were set following the "criteria setting meeting" of Takaka FLAG on 21st August 2015.
 
# Groundwater level (Economic)#
#### *Description* ####
The minimum groundwater level in the Takaka unconfined gravels aquifer (TUGA) at the Fire Station (metres above sea level). Note the ground surface at the Fire Station is at about 10 m above sea level.
#### *Scenario values* ####
Used groundwater model outputs (Weir and Fenemor 2015). Note that the different aquifers have different responses, but this attribute is an Economic Value measure related to salt water intrusion and groundwater take limits both of which are applicable to the TUGA. Note also that the TUGA is found to increase with irrigation recharge. 

Uncertainty estimates indicate that the modelled groundwater levels over the full range (~3 m) of levels  for the "status quo" scenario are within 0.3 m of that which was observed.

#### *Criteria settings* ####
Criteria settings were set based on the increased depth to groundwater resulting in decreased pumping efficiency. The maximum lift for a surface pump is about 9.8 m, say 6 m to be conservative. Assume 2 m of drawdown during pumping, so more than 4 m below ground level (i.e. less than 6 m above sea level) and pumping becomes very difficult, this was set as the orange-red level. The green-yellow was set to 6.6 m above sea level, which is the minimum observed groundwater level (i.e. the "status quo" scenario value). The yellow-orange level was set to half way between the green-yellow and the orange-red values 
The minimum was set to the “natural” scenario value of 5.3 m above sea level. The maximum was arbitrarily set to 7 m above ground level which is 0.3 m above the minimum groundwater level observed at the Fire Station. Lower green was set to 6.7 m, yellow/orange set to 6.5 m and upper red set to 6.3 m. These values were set following the "criteria setting meeting" of Takaka FLAG on 21st August 2015.
 
# Nitrate-nitrogen concentrations (Cultural and spiritual)#
#### *Description* ####
Nitrate-Nitrogen concentrations at Te Waikorupupu Springs (grams per cubic metre)
#### *Scenario values* ####
Used modeled (Weir and Fenemor 2015) estimates for the “Status Quo”, “no consumptive use” , “double irrigation" and "natural state" scenarios. "Irrig1:3" were estimated based on a linear interpolation of "status quo" and "double irrigation" according to irrigated area. Used the load estimated for the “Status Quo” scenario to determine the concentrations using the modelled flows for the remaining scenarios.
#### *Criteria settings* ####
Maximum was set to 0.
The other values were set by consensus during the FLAG meeting 26th June 2015. 
Lower limit of the "green" range was set to 0.37 g/m<sup>3</sup>. The lower "yellow" limit was set to 0.5 g/m<sup>2</sup>, the lower "orange" limit set to 1 g/m<sup>3</sup> which is the “A” class limit in the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management 2014 (New Zealand Government 2014). Minimum was set to 2 g/m<sup>2</sup>.
 
 
# Drinking water quality (Drinking water)#
#### *Description* ####
95th percentile of 12 months of E.coli sample measurements (bacteria per 100 ml) of the Takaka drinking water supply.
#### *Scenario values* ####
E.coli dies when it goes into the groundwater. Only if there was a very large amount of E.Coli and/or it entered the groundwater very close to a drinking supply, would it affect the groundwater.
 The source of the water in the aquifer at Takaka township is primarily the Takaka river to the south west and the land between the river and the town. Both the river and the land provide a source for E. Coli. Measurements from Takaka at Kotinga indicate 95th percentile sample measurements can reach over 100 E.Coli / 100 ml. Based on a transmisivity of 5000 m/day a depth of 10 m (Thomas and Harvey 2013) a hydraulic gradient of 0.004 and a porosity of 10 %, the travel time of water from the Takaka River to the township is estimated at 60 days. E. Coli dies when it enters the soil and the groundwater at an exponential rate that depends on the location. International estimates of the mean inactivation rate of 0.07 - 0.1 log<sub>10</sub> per day (John and Rose 2005) indicate that for E.Coli concentration of 100 E.Coli/100 ml (the 95th percentile for Takaka at Kotinga), the E.Coli concentration would drop to 0.007 E.Coli / 100 ml after 60 days. This value was allocated to the "Status Quo", "All irrigation from groundwater","No Cobb Dam", and "No Waingaro River" scenarios. The "Irrig1:3", "Double irrigation","no consumptive use" and "natural state" scenarios used an altered estimate of the Takaka River E.Coli concentrations according to the estimated change in cow numbers (see milk solids attribute for details) allowing for an unchanging base concentration (taken from the Takaka at Harwoods observations) before applying the inactivation rates to find the 60 day survival concentrations. That is, the change in E.Coli from Harwoods to Kotinga (91 E.Coli / 100 ml) was related to the total number of cows in the valley (~14455 cows).
Note that potential exists for E.Coli to enter the drinking water aquifer from the farmland between Takaka and the the Takaka River. While the soil in this region is classified as having a low likelihood of through-transport of microbes (McLeod et al 2008) under the right conditions (e.g. high intensity rainfall following high stocking rates) the E.Coli concentrations in the shallow drinking water bores in the town may exceed the New Zealand drinking water standards. Note that Te Kakau at Haldane Rd (adjacent to the town and sourced from the same groundwater) had high E.Coli when samples were taken in 2005 and 2006. Sample measurements from council operated bores within the Takaka township have never shown any E.Coli (Joseph Thomas, TDC, pers communication). While the likelihood of drinking water samples being taken at the same time that E.Coli concentrations are high is very low, the lack of illness in the town is taken as some indication that the supply, under current conditions, is acceptable.
#### *Criteria settings* ####
Based on [NZ Drinking water standards](http://www.health.govt.nz/publication/drinking-water-standards-new-zealand-2005-revised-2008 "Drinking-water Standards for New Zealand 2005 (Revised 2008)"). Lower limit of green was set to 0.998 E.coli/100 ml and the upper limit of red set to 1 E.coli/100 ml. In this way the drinking water quality is only ever good (green) or bad (red). These values were set following the "criteria setting meeting" of Takaka FLAG on 21st August 2015.
 
# Swimming water quality (Recreation)#
### *Description* ###
Percentage of weekly samples through summer that exceed 260 E.Coli/100 ml (the national guidelines "alert level" (MFE 2013)) at the Takaka swimming hole at Paynes Ford.
#### *Scenario values* ####
"Status Quo", "All irrigation from groundwater","No Cobb Dam", and "No Waingaro River" scenario values are from the observed data between 2002 and 2015 where 10 or more samples were taken. The changed irrigation scenarios altered estimates of the E.Coli concentrations according to the estimated change in cow numbers (see milk solids attribute for details)   before determining the number of alert exceedances. This method assumes a linear relationship between E.Coli concentrations and cow numbers and assumes that the daily variation in E.Coli is climatically controlled.
#### *Criteria settings* ####
Minimum set to 0 %, maximum to 100 %, lower green set to 5 %, lower yellow set to 10 %, upper red set to 15 %. These values were set following the "criteria setting meeting" of Takaka FLAG on 21st August 2015.
 
# Periphyton (Recreation)#
#### *Description* ####
Percentage coverage of summertime filamentous periphyton for the Motupipi at Reillys Bridge.
#### *Scenario values* ####
The regression model for mean annual maximum filamentous periphyton as per Snelder et al. (2014) was used. The change in periphyton cover was estimated by applying the change in the hydrological parameters (i.e. flow statistics from the groundwater model of Weir and Fenemor 2015) and assuming the other model variables (temperature, radiation, nitrogen and the ratio of reactive phosphorous to dissolved inorganic nitrogen) were constant.

ChangeInPeriphytonCover = -0.177 (FRE2<sub>1</sub> - FRE2<sub>2</sub>) - 0.016(nNeg<sub>1</sub> - nNeg<sub>2</sub>) - 5.908(LowFlow<sub>1</sub> - LowFlow<sub>2</sub>) 

FRE2 is the frequency of floods per year that are more than twice the median flow.  
nNeg is the number of days a year that the flow is less than the previous day.  
LowFlow is the MALF divided by the mean flow.  
MALF is the 7 day mean annual low flow.  
The “status quo” scenario value was taken as the average observed summer filamentous periphyton cover at Motupipi of 18 % (pers comms. Trevor James). "Irrig1:3" scenario values kept the same as "status Quo"
#### *Criteria settings* ####

Max set to 0, Min set to 30 % following table 3 of Snelder et al. (2014) for mean annual maximum filamentamous periphyton. Yellow orange set to 12 %, lower green set to 6 %, upper red set to 18 %. These values were set following the "criteria setting meeting" of Takaka FLAG on 21st August 2015.
 
# Clarity (Recreation)#
#### *Description* ####
The long term median of distance underwater that a submerged 200 mm diameter black disk can be seen in the swimming hole at Paynes Ford on summertime non-flood days (m)
#### *Scenario values* ####
Used the Aqualinc LimSim model which has an empirical model of clarity from McDowell and others (2013) based on region and percentage pasture. "Status Quo" offset to match the median value (4.6 m) observed on the Takaka at Paynes Ford since 2010 as provided by TDC. "Natural state" estimated by setting the percentage pasture to 0, finding the model result and applying the offset used for "Status Quo". The difference between "Natural" and "Status Quo" was linearly extrapolated to other land use intensities based on estimated cow numbers (see Milk  Solids attribute).
#### *Criteria settings* ####
yellow-green boundary set to 75th percentile of available observations (6.5 m). Orange-red boundary set to 2 m. Yellow-orange boundary set to half way between the outer boundaries.
These values were set following the "criteria setting meeting" of Takaka FLAG on 29th July 2015.
Note that "trigger" value for lowland streams is 0.75 m as per Davies-Colley 2000. 
 
# Supply security (Economic)#
#### *Description* ####
The annual average percentage of time that October to March (incl) 15 minute flows are less than 1.657 m<sup>3</sup>/s at the Harwoods recorder on the Takaka river. This flow rate is the most conservative irrigation restriction currently in place.
#### *Scenario values* ####
The Harwoods recorder is above the irrigation takes, so the restriction is only affected by the “no Cobb Dam” scenario and the “natural state” scenario. Values are derived from the groundwater modelling (Weir and Fenemor 2015). The "no consumptive use" scenarios has little meaning for this scenario as there is no supply that needs securing. "Status Quo" value was taken from the data for the 1990-2014 period. A relationship between the 15 minute based supply security and the daily supply security was obtained from the observed data. [15MinRestr]=1.59[DailyRestr]+0.0124. This relationship was applied to the daily supply security determined for the modelled daily flows for the "natural" and "no Cobb" scenarios. 
#### *Criteria settings* ####
Min is set to 100, max to 0, red-orange to 6 %, orange-yellow to 4 %, yellow-green to 2 %. These values were set following the "criteria setting meeting" of Takaka FLAG on 21st August 2015.
 
# Fish habitat (Fishing & food gathering)#
#### *Description* ####
Percentage change in available Brown Trout habitat in the Takaka. Note that Brown Trout is modelled as being more sensitive than short finned eels to flow changes.
#### *Scenario values* ####
Change in fish habitat is estimated using mean annual flow (determined from the groundwater model of Weir and Fenemor 2015) as input to the generalised habitat model described in section 8.1 of Jowett et al. (2008) and implemented in the Aqualinc LimSim model.
#### *Criteria settings* ####
Min is set to -100 %, max to +100 %. Yellow-green is set to 0 % (i.e. the statis quo), orange-yellow set to -5 % and orange-red set to -10 %. These values were set following the "criteria setting meeting" of Takaka FLAG on 29th July 2015.

# Cultural Health (Cultural and spiritual)#
#### *Description* ####
Cultural Health Index for stream health on a scale from 1-5 (Tipa and Tierney 2006) at Kotinga. 
#### *Scenario values* ####
Unknown "Status quo" value, arbitrarily set to 3. 
Following appendix 4 of Tippa 2006, each scenario was assessed for its likelihood to change one of the index's stream health indicators, and the direction of change. The index was adjusted by 1/8 for each affected indicator."Irrig1:3" scenarios adjusted a proportion of the "Double Irrigation" change according to the relative change in cow numbers#### *Criteria settings* ####
Minimum set to 1, maximum set to 5. Lower green set to 4, lower yellow set to 3, lower orange set to 2. These values were set following the "criteria setting meeting" of Takaka FLAG on 21st August 2015.
